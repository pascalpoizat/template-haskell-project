This is a simple template for Haskell projects built with Stack / LTS Haskell 7.19 (ghc-8.0.1).

## Installation

Due to `stack` installing and using working files in projects, you cannot just clone the template.
The first step to create your project is:

```
stack new projectname
```

Then go into the new directory that has been created and initialize `git` versioning.

```
cd projectname
git init
```

Now you can setup the remote for getting the template and get it.

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/pascalpoizat/template-haskell-project.git
git fetch
git checkout -ft origin/master
```

You no longer need the remote (of course you may then have your own one to work with).

```
git remote rm origin
```

Before playing around with the project you will have to change names in some places.
First rename `template-haskell-project.cabal` into `projectname.cabal`.

```
mv template-haskell-project.cabal projectname.cabal
```

Then replace all instances of the string `template-haskell-project` by `projectname`:

- in the Cabal configuration file, `projectname.cabal` (there should be 7 instances)
- in the Travis CI configuration file, `.travis.yml`  (there should be 3 instances)
- if you keep it for the badges, in the Readme file, `README.md` (there should be 9 instances), and also go to the Travis CI, Coveralls, and Waffle sites to link the repository of your project to them.

You can now build and run your project with:

```
stack build
stack exec projectname-exe
```

You can run your tests (and build the documentation + coverage information) with:

```
stack clean; stack test :projectname-test  --coverage --haddock --no-haddock-deps
```

It is working. Have fun with Haskell!
